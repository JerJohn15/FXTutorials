# FXTutorials
A collection of game related tutorials on JavaFX from my channel on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/almasb0/videos

I've configured this project to work with Netbeans, so you'll need the latest version of that. Alternatively, you could use your own tool.

#ToDo

- [ ] Add menu for frogger game (this menu will include an option to play or exit the game, as well as instructions to play it)
- [ ] Add some transitions to the created Frogger game menu.
- [ ] Add some Unit Tests (using JUnit).
